Privacy Policy for AntiHabit

Last updated: 06.02.2026

1. Overview  
AntiHabit is an app that helps you track short breaks (e.g. coffee, smoke, beer, wine). We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our servers.

2. Data stored on your device  
The app may store information locally on your device (for example, how many breaks you’ve completed today). This data stays on your device and is not sent to us or any third party.

3. Device sensors  
AntiHabit may use your device’s motion sensors (e.g. accelerometer) only to provide in-app effects (such as tilting liquids). This data is not stored or sent to us.

4. No account or tracking  
We do not require an account. We do not use analytics or advertising that track you across apps or websites.

5. Changes  
We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the latest version.

6. Contact  
If you have questions about this policy, contact us at: ovidiu.varo@gmail.com
